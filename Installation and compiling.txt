	/----------------------\
	  Installation & Setup
	\----------------------/

In order to run this program, you'll need to install Python 2 and a few modules. 
Any version of python between 2.7.12 up to the latest 2.7 should work.




	/----------------------\
	       Compilation
	\----------------------/


This program uses cx-Freeze to compile into an executable, so you'll need to
install that using "pip install cx-Freeze" on command line after python has
been installed.

To compile the program, you just need to run the "Build Executable.bat" script.
That batch file is a simple wrapper for the setup.py script.
