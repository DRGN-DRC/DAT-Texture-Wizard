# DAT-Texture-Wizard (DTW)
This program allows for disc (ISO/GCM) management of GameCube games, as well as texture exporting and importing, particularly for Super Smash Bros. Melee and 20XXHP. The internal file structure of HAL DAT files can also be analyzed and edited.

Disc management features include adding/replacing/deleting files and/or folders (including replacing files that are larger than the original), building a disc from root files, editing the game names (short/long titles, descriptions, etc.), replacing the disc banner, and more.
