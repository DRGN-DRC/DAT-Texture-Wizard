# To 6.1.1:
#
# - Fixed a small bug that could prevent saving a disc when a rebuilt file already exists
# - Refactoring and code clean-up


# Todo:
# getImageFileAsPNG may be completely depricated. remove it?
# Texture decoding now handled in separate processes when fetching many textures
# make editedBannerEntries and edited dat entries appropriately set color when Entry widgets are re-created
# Disc file descriptions can now be added/edited in '.\File Descriptions\GALE01.ini' (generate a file if one doesn't exist; check for it upon loading a disc)
# audio file descriptions & images
# channel value input on palette color changer?
# limit texture import dimensions to 1024?
# paletted texture imports via manual placements tab
# Disc Import Method support for the DOL
# dynamic switching between xxhash architectures for compilation (and DnD module). perhaps in setup file?
# 'Extract Disc for Dolphin' feature?
# switch to built-in dnd module?? "C:\Python27\Lib\lib-tk\Tkdnd.py"
# change how entry field saving is done. queue changes immediately rather than 'on Enter'. save list of objects with necessary info, validate & make changes on save
# Disc Import Method support for the game banner?
# disable texture feature (zero-out header pointer?)
# should drag-n-drop on the iso tab (for dats) instead import the dat? prompt for option?
# .identify() to improve scrolling scenarios?
# import type 14 texture over 8?
# quick texture adjustments/editor?
# fix DK neutral to red CCC. Samus pink to lavender: 1 skipped texture?
# sound effects?
# search through english files only when scanning with next/prev buttons? 
# allow for multiple image types in filters
# give error message when trying to export a texture with 'no image available'
# live usb disk editing???
# report to user of texture filtering validation
# Texture Operation: Activate Identifier Mode
# clear option for remembered files
# getFileTotals() to return (totalFiles, totalFileSize), for "Exporting File x of y...." program status
# import multiple/all images (in the currently loaded dat file)
# stylize image headers area (check Entry options, disabled state, borders, etc.)
# Search feature for file tree
# enable/disable menubar items (like texture ops) when unavailable: https://mail.python.org/pipermail/tkinter-discuss/2004-September/000204.html
# pleasant blue color: 0099f0
